# keras-regression-house-prices

Special thanks to [Adrian Rosebrock](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/author/adrian/)   for his [great post](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/01/21/regression-with-keras/) 

This is a simple code  creates and train a neural network to predict house prices

usage 'python  housePrice_regression.py'


The data set is from   https://github.com/emanhamed/Houses-dataset



The house dataset includes four numerical and categorical attributes:

1. Number of bedrooms (continous)
2. Number of bathrooms(continous)
3. Area (continous)
4. Zip code (Cateogiral)



When training finishes the following, curves shown the traning and validation  loss is shown. Another curce will also be shown for actualvs predicted prices. Both curves are saved to local drive
